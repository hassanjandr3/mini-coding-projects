this game has a simple retro UI made to simulate early game types
while playing you need to imput a number form 1-20 and as you press enter
the game will show the following results
1:you win. in which the ui will shift to green and your score will be noted
2:too low. which means the number you submitted is lower than the orignal number a point form your score (20) is reduced
3:too high. which means the number you submitted is higher than the orignal number and a point form your score (20) is reduced
once you win if the score is higher than the previous trys, your score will be recorded in the high score
once you win if the scored is higher than the previous trys, your score will not be noted in the high score
pressing try again will reset the game and the ui but not the highest score

Future plans/pull request suggestions:
add a player name section
a player game log with the name will be stored (already used name will override the saved log score)
format the log so that the highest scores are at the top
what will this achive: if more than 1 player has the highest record it will be stored in the log and players can get sense of acompisheent
